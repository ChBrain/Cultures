"""Shared finding/issue records for Cultures validators.

Validators are read-only. They emit `Issue` records describing what is wrong
and, where the architecture's hierarchy determines the answer, a `verdict`
naming the winner. Whoever consumes the output (an LLM, a human, CI) reads
the verdict line to decide whether to act mechanically or escalate.

Verdict semantics:
  - `verdict` set     -> hierarchy resolved the conflict; the verdict states
                        what the file should look like. The next operation
                        is determined.
  - `verdict` is None -> no parent in the hierarchy can arbitrate. Human
                        engagement required.
